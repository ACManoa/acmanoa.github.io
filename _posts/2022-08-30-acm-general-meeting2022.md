## Welcome to Fall Semester 2022! 

The Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) held it's first ACM General Meeting to all ICS Students and individuals at POST 127 on August 30th at 4:30PM - 6:00PM.

Here at the University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa, ACM connects students with professional networking opportunities, internships, researches, and collaborative resources. Some of our professional connections include Apple, Microsoft, Github, NSA, and many, many more.
We represent a greater, national ACM, which may be known for awarding the ACM A.M Turing awards,  often regarded as the “Nobel Prize of Computing.”

## Available Opportunities

The ACM General Meeting aims to expose students to the wide variety of ICS clubs available to them.
