## What is Datathon?  (Draft)

Datathon, similar to a hackathon, is a weekend-long event where students collaborate in teams to develop a data science project that solves a problem announced at the event. 


## Event Information (Draft)

ACM at University of Hawaii at Manoa is proud to announce their first Datathon that will take place from **March 9** of 2024 to **March 10**. Registrations will open on **January 9**.

## Title (Draft)

Kanehekili Datathon

“Kanehekili is the name of the demi-god of thunder in Hawaiian culture. An example of Kane worship in the name of one of these lesser deities is illustrated in the description given by Kamakau of the place held by Kane-hekili (Kane in the thunder) as an aumakua on the island of Maui. Kane-hekili as god of thunder is associated with Kane-wawahi-lani (Kane breaking through heaven), Ka-uila-nui-maka-keha‘i-i-ka-lani (Lightning flashing in the heavens), Ka-hoali‘i, and other gods whose names suggest the lively phenomena of a thunderstorm.

Kane is one of the four main male gods in Hawaiian culture”

The first _kahu_ who observed the kapus of these gods was named Hekili (Thunder). He lived at Papaʻaea in Hamakualoa, Maui. The land of Papaʻaea where this man was born is a place where thunder claps very loudly, with double claps, and there come flashes of lightning that smash to pieces the forest of ʻOʻopuloa.
