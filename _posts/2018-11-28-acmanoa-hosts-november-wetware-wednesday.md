On November 28th 2018 ACManoa hosted November's WetWare Wednesday in the UH iLab (Building 37), right alongside the ICS department. WetWare Wednesday is a monthly networking event that brings together the local software development community in Hawaii. 

## Agenda

Speakers for the event included ACM Board Members: Vice-President **Ty Uehara** and Treasurer **Isaac DeMello**, as well as ICS faculty members: **Dr. Peter Sadowski** and **Dr. Phillip Johnson**.

This WetWare featured an expo of both student and faculty projects being worked on at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. We are happy so many people came out to support their fellow classmates as they presented their latest and greatest tech creations.
