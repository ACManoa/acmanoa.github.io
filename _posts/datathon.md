## What Is Kanehekili?

Kanehekili is the name of the demi-god of thunder in Hawaiian culture. 
The first kahu who observed the kapus of these gods was named Hekili (Thunder). He lived at Papaʻaea in Hamakualoa, Maui. The land of Papaʻaea where this man was born is a place where thunder claps very loudly, with double claps, and there come flashes of lightning that smash to pieces the forest of ʻOʻopuloa.
