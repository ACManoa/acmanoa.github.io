## Come Join us at the Okinawan Festival!

Started in 1982 by the Hawaii United Okinawa Association, the Okinawan Festival celebrates all things Okinawan and brings together Okinawans and Okinawans-at-heart. Our theme of "Sharing Uchinanchu Aloha" is embedded in everything we do.  Join us for the ono food, beautiful performances, educational cultural exhibits and much more.

On Saturday September 3rd & Sunday September 4th this year at the Hawaii Convention Center, ACM held a volunteering event to support the Okinawan festival. The Okinawan Festival is one of Hawaii's largest ethnic festivals. In support for Hawaii's community and for awareness of cultural diversity, ACM spread its members across different stations to assists with questions, directions, and line management across the festival.
