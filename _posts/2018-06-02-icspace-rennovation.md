From the dates of May 29th to June 2nd, ICSpace was closed for rennovations.

Now, it is back to it's normal operations as study room for ICS students.

## Why?
We decided to rennovate the room because we wanted to give it a new feel. We wanted to change the way the room operates, and giving it a new look would help prepare it for that. Plus it really needed to be cleaned.

Here are some before and after pictures of the room for you to see.
