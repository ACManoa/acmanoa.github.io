## What do we do?

This club aims to familiarize students with using Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as IntelliJ IDEA and VSCode to build websites and web-based applications for ACM through collaborative group work using React (a popular Javascript Library). 

## Our Mission

ACM Manoa Software Development offers a valuable chance to enhance web development skills, build connections with peers, and gain practical experience. It provides opportunities to collaborate on application building while strengthening problem-solving skills, communication, and punctuality.
