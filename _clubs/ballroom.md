## What is Ballroom Dance Club?

Ballroom dancing is a fun and engaging physical activity that offers stress relief and opportunities to build friendships with other members. It can help improve your posture, boost your confidence, and even enhance your resume. Interestingly, many of the top Adult Amateur ballroom dancers in the US are Computer Science or Engineering majors and graduates — you might even have one of them interview you for your next job!

Here are links to some of our performances:

## What We Do

Each semester, we learn the basics of various ballroom dances, including the Waltz, Cha-cha, Tango, Rumba, Foxtrot, and Swing. Beyond our general meetings, we have opportunities to perform for the ballroom dance community in Hawaii. We also participate in the ballroom dance competitions held twice a year in the state, and in 2024, we had the chance to compete nationally at the DanceSport Championships. Typically, we have at least one performance and one competition each semester.

## Everyone is Welcome

The Ballroom Dance Club encourages non-dancers and beginners to join and learn how to ballroom dance. No dance experience is required to join the club!

<p style="font-size: 1.5	rem; font-weight: bold;">
  We meet every Tuesday at 6pm in Studio 2 of the Athletic Complex at University of Hawaii at Manoa.
</p>

Our beginners session is 6:00pm to 7:30pm, during which we learn basic steps of several styles. We continue to build upon them throughout the semester. Our advanced session is 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm, that’s when we work on technique as well as training students for future performances and competitions. Make sure to wear shoes!
