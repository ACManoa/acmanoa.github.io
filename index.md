# Our Goals and Mission Statment
 <strong style = "font-size: 1.2rem"><center> "ACManoa creates opportunities at UH Manoa to forge connections between students and Hawaii's burgeoning IT industry."</center></strong>

ACManoa has three goals -- to provide _social_, _professional_, and _technical_ enrichment for our members. We provide events of all three kinds to meet our three goals.
- We hold social events for our members to develop and strengthen their interpersonal relationships as well as to have fun.
- We hold professional development events to connect our members to professionals in the industry within the local community as well as abroad
- We also hold technical workshops and other types of technical enrichment events.
